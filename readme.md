# Catch Me Game [Link](https://shantanumurdio.github.io/class_Assignment_13/)

This is a simple web-based game where you need to catch a moving box using your mouse pointer. The box will randomly change its position when you hover over it.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (styles are defined in `styles.css`)
- JavaScript (game logic is implemented in `script.js`)

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. You will see a colored box with the text "Catch ME!!" inside it.
3. Move your mouse pointer over the box to try and catch it.
4. The box will move to a random position within the viewport when you hover over it, so be quick!

## Code Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: Defines the styles for the game elements.
- `script.js`: Implements the game logic and box movement.
